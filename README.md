#Pokémon Database Project

Overview
This project aims to provide a detailed analysis and visualization of Pokémon data spanning Generations 1 through 9. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset graciously provided by Cadenloya from KhanAcademy.org, we explore various aspects of Pokémon, including their types, average stats, distribution across types, and the strongest Mega Evolutions. This README outlines the project structure, the SQL queries used for data analysis, and instructions on how to set up and run the project.

Dataset
